# Field Snap AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Type Safety First
Every piece of code must be fully type-safe using TypeScript. All inputs, outputs,
and intermediate values require explicit type definitions. Use Zod for runtime
validation at system boundaries. No `any` types allowed except in documented
edge cases with explicit justification.

### II. Test-Driven Development
Write tests before implementation. Every new feature starts with failing tests
that define expected behavior. Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly.
Maintain minimum 80% code coverage with focus on critical business logic paths.

### III. Mobile-First Architecture
Design and implement all interfaces for mobile devices first. Progressive
enhancement for larger screens. Touch-friendly interactions, optimized payload
sizes, and offline-capable design patterns are mandatory for user-facing features.

### IV. Security by Design
Never trust user input. Validate and sanitize all data at entry points.
Implement defense in depth with authentication, authorization, and audit
logging. Use environment variables for secrets. Apply principle of least
privilege for all service accounts and API keys.

### V. Performance Optimization
Measure before optimizing. Set clear performance budgets: API responses
under 200ms p95, image processing under 3 seconds, lead scoring under 500ms.
Use caching strategically. Implement lazy loading and code splitting for
frontend assets.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All code must pass TypeScript strict mode compilation
- ESLint configuration must be enforced with no warnings
- Prettier formatting applied to all files
- Maximum function complexity (cyclomatic) of 10
- Maximum file length of 300 lines (excluding tests)

### API Design Standards
- RESTful principles for all HTTP endpoints
- Consistent error response format with proper HTTP status codes
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all public APIs
- Versioning strategy for breaking changes
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints

### Database Practices
- All database changes through versioned migration scripts
- Row-level security policies for multi-tenant data
- Indexes on all foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Soft deletes for audit trail preservation
- Connection pooling with appropriate limits

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Checks
- Type checking must pass (`bun run type-check`)
- Linting must pass with no errors (`bun run lint`)
- Unit tests must pass (`bun test`)
- Commit messages follow conventional commits format

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- All tests passing (unit, integration, contract)
- Security scan completed with no high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met per defined budgets
- Documentation updated for any API changes
- Database migrations tested in staging environment

### Production Monitoring
- Application logs aggregated and searchable
- Error tracking with alerting thresholds
- Performance metrics dashboard maintained
- Uptime monitoring with incident response plan
- Regular security audit schedule (monthly)

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines.
Any deviation requires explicit documentation in the Complexity Tracking
section with clear justification. Regular review quarterly or when major
architectural changes are proposed.

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes via pull request with rationale
2. Team review and discussion (minimum 48 hours)
3. Consensus or majority vote for approval
4. Version bump following semantic versioning
5. Update all dependent documentation

### Compliance Enforcement
- All pull requests must verify constitutional compliance
- Automated checks where possible via CI/CD pipeline
- Manual review checklist for principles not easily automated
- Violations tracked and addressed before merge
- Quarterly compliance audit and reporting
